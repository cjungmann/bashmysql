# BASH MySQL

This program will run an MySQL query and return the resulting result rows to a
callback function.  It is an enhancement of the `parsql` script found in my
[gensfw project](https://github.com/cjungmann/gensfw) with a more complete
mission and can stand alone as a useful tool.

A change from my usual practice, I am writing this README file before I have
any code in the project.  I'll flesh this out when I have a working script.
